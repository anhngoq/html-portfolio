<h3>The Revenant</h3>
<p>
    Amazing movie. The emotions, the settings, the motivations, ... All are well done. 
    It made me sad though.

<h3>The Red Turtle</h3>
<p>
    The characters didn't even say anything but I cried like a baby. Loved the animation.
</p>
<h3>Three Idiots</h3>
<p>
    Almost peed from laughter while watching this movie. Cannot underestimate Bollywood.
